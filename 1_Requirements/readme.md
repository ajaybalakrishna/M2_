OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT :
This Project is digitally secured lock based on password verification.The system uses a seven segment display array to show the password, a matrix keypad to enter the numbers/password and operates a relay (to activate the solenoid valve) for locking and unlocking purpose. The password is stored in the EEPROM of the microcontroller so that, power failure or reset of the system does not affect the password recognition.

INTRODUCTION :
 This Project is digitally secured lock based on password verification.The system uses a seven segment display array to show the password, a matrix keypad to enter the numbers/password and operates a relay  for locking and unlocking purpose.

PRINCIPLE:


COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES :
ATMega328
Seven segment
Resistor
LED's
Voltage Source
Connecting wires
Buzzer
Applications of Password :
These devices are used in many location major role in sequire
 are commonly found in lockers 
Used as part of a SCADA system to perform functions such as counting the number of packages on a moving conveyor belt.
Advantages and Disadvantages :
Advantages :
It's simple to combine with lighting systems like automatic lighting.
It is used to reduce energy consumption or manage energy by controlling the brightness level of mobile phones and turning on and off street lights based on the amount of ambient light.
Light sensors based on LDR (i.e. photoresistor) technology come in a variety of shapes and sizes.
The operation of light sensors necessitates a low voltage and power supply.
Photoresistors are less expensive, bi-directional, and have a medium response time.
Photodiodes have a fast response time, are less expensive, and produce digital output.
In comparison to photoresistors, phototransistors are extremely quick and deliver rapid output.
In comparison to photodiodes, phototransistors generate a lot of current.
Disadvantages :
LDRs are inherently incorrect and have a long response time (about 10s or 100s of milliseconds).
Photoresistor resistance varies continuously (analogue) and is rough in character.
Photodiodes, unlike photoresistors, are temperature sensitive and unidirectional.
Phototransistors are not able to withstand voltages more than 1000 volts.
Surges, spikes, and EM energy can damage phototransistors.
Cost and Availability :
Due to its basic architecture, the ldr sensor is inexpensive and widely available in the market, both offline and online. It's possible that the version available differs from mine (attached above).
